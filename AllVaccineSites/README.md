The All Vaccine Sites folder includes information about every COVID-19 vaccination distribution center on Staten Island. Within the attribute table, there is information about the name of the center, if it is a walk in or by appointment, which vaccines they offer, and an ID to seperate each one. 

Quick note, several vaccine centers have the same name (such as CVS Pharmacy); they are distinguished by the street name or cross street name they are located on.
