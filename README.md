# COVID-19 on Staten Island
## Project developed by Vincenzo Mezzio
This project is a continuation of my final project in my Geographic Information Systems class that studied the cause and effects of COVID-19 on Staten Island


## Installation and Setup
For my class, we used the application QGIS version 2.18.28 to develop our maps. This is the version of the software I used to continue the project. To download the software to view the maps in QGIS, you can refer to this link: https://download.osgeo.org/qgis/ Select your operating system and download QGIS OSGeo4W 2.18.28.

After the software downloads, you should have a folder on your desktop named QGIS 2.18 with the shortcut to open the application either through the browser or through the desktop app (QGIS Desktop 2.18.28).

Afterwards, select Project > Open > select the Project File from the appropriately named folder.

This map demonstrates the locations of all vaccination distribution centers on Staten Island. Each distribution center is labeled by the street it is located on, which is important for certain distribution centers that have multiple locations on Staten Island (such as CVS Pharmacy). I also characterized each location by residents being able to walk in for the vaccine or by scheduling an appointment for the vaccine. I found it would be important to see if residents would be more willing to receive the vaccine if they could simply walk in to receive the vaccine. Interestingly, I have found that not many distribution centers offer the vaccine as a walk in. I have concluded that walk-in vaccination centers are not a large factor in residents willing to receive the vaccines; rather, an area with more vaccines would most likely have more residents receive the vaccinations. The number of vaccinations received is demonstrated in a choropleth method (graduating color scheme from white to blue, blue indicating more residents have received the vaccination). The zip code 10314 has 9 vaccination distribution centers (one of them offers walk in vaccination) and this zip code has the most vaccinations (at least 33,000 first dose vaccinations as of May 17th, 2021. Other zip codes such as 10310, 10307, and 10302 which have 1, 2, and 3 vaccination centers respectively have the lowest number of vaccinations (approximately 5,000 to 10,000 vaccinations). The more vaccination centers that are present, the more likely Staten Island residents would receive the vaccination.

## Quick note 
Map 10, COVID-19 cases and ethnicities was removed due to the lack of connection with this data and other data within the research.
