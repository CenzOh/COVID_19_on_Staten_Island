# COVID-19 on Staten Island
## Project developed by Vincenzo Mezzio
This project is a continuation of my final project in my Geographic Information Systems class that studied the cause and effects of COVID-19 on Staten Island


## Installation and Setup
For my class, we used the application QGIS version 2.18.28 to develop our maps. This is the version of the software I used to continue the project. To download the software to view the maps in QGIS, you can refer to this link: https://download.osgeo.org/qgis/ Select your operating system and download QGIS OSGeo4W 2.18.28.

After the software downloads, you should have a folder on your desktop named QGIS 2.18 with the shortcut to open the application either through the browser or through the desktop app (QGIS Desktop 2.18.28).

Afterwards, select Project > Open > select the Project File from the appropriately named folder.
